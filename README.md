# Business Problem
For this project, you have been hired to produce a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. Ultimately, you will use this database to analyze what makes a movie successful, and will provide recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.

- Part 1: Download several files from IMDBâ€™s movie data set and filter out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder.
- Part 2: Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to your IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis.
- Part 3: Construct and export a MySQL database using your data.
- Part 4: Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.
- Part 5 (Optional): Produce a Linear Regression model to predict movie performance.

# The Data
- The stakeholder identified The Movie Database (TMDB) as a great source of financial data (https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- The dataset files can be accessed and downloaded from https://datasets.imdbws.com/.
- Data Source: https://www.themoviedb.org/about/logos-attribution
